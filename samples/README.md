- FPS counter
- Adjustable detection thresholds

### 7. [07_multi_model](./07_multi_model/)
**Multiple Models** - Switch between different models
- Load multiple models
- Switch between tasks dynamically
- Memory management
- Performance comparison

### 8. [08_custom_ui](./08_custom_ui/)
**Custom UI and Visualization** - Advanced UI customization
- Custom drawing of results
- Animation effects
- Result filtering
- Advanced visualization techniques

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Flutter SDK installed
2. Android Studio / Xcode for platform-specific setup
3. YOLO model files (.tflite for Android, .mlmodel for iOS)

### Running a Sample

1. Navigate to the sample directory:
   ```bash
   cd samples/01_basic_detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Add your model files:
   - Android: Place `.tflite` files in `android/app/src/main/assets/`
   - iOS: Add `.mlmodel` files via Xcode to the Runner target

4. Run the sample:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üì± Model Files

You can obtain model files from:

1. **Ultralytics Hub**: https://hub.ultralytics.com
2. **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app/releases
3. **Export from Python**:
   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   
   model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt')
   model.export(format='tflite')  # For Android
   model.export(format='coreml')  # For iOS
   ```

## üìù Code Structure

Each sample follows a similar structure:
```
sample_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart          # Main application code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.yaml           # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Sample-specific documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/           # Sample screenshots
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ demo.png
```

## üéØ Learning Path

We recommend going through the samples in order:

1. Start with **01_basic_detection** to understand the basics
2. Try **06_camera_detection** for real-time detection
3. Explore task-specific samples (02-05) based on your needs
4. Advanced users can check **07_multi_model** and **08_custom_ui**

## üí° Tips

- Each sample is self-contained and can be used as a starting point for your own app
- Code is heavily commented in both English and Japanese
- Check the individual README files in each sample for specific details
- All samples use the same model files, so you can reuse them
