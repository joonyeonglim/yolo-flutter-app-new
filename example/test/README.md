# Tests for Example App

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the example application, ensuring reliability and functionality across different scenarios.

## 🧪 Test Structure

The test suite is organized to validate various aspects of the example application:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality validation
- **Widget Tests**: UI component behavior verification
- **Performance Tests**: Application performance benchmarks

## 🔄 Current Status

Tests are currently being refactored to improve coverage and maintainability. The updated test suite will include:

- Enhanced test coverage for [YOLO model integration](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/)
- Improved [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/) test scenarios
- Better error handling validation
- Performance optimization tests

## 🚀 Running Tests

Once the refactoring is complete, you'll be able to run tests using standard Flutter testing commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test files
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

## 📋 Test Categories

The upcoming test suite will cover:

- **Model Loading**: Verification of [YOLO model](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) initialization
- **Image Processing**: Input validation and preprocessing tests
- **Detection Accuracy**: Output validation for various object types
- **UI Responsiveness**: User interface interaction tests
- **Error Scenarios**: Edge case and error handling validation
